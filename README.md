# Go React 

**Go React** is a template designed for creating cross-platform applications with a web interface using the Go programming language and React (TS + SWC).

The end result of this template is a single executable binary. This binary serves as a web server, hosting both the React frontend and an API.

:warning: This template is still a work in progress :construction:
